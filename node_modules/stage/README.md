# Includable Stage

**The simple way to build your next app. With built-in authentication, front-end components, navigation and more.**

---

Includable Stage is currently in development. We're a long way out from something usable, but so far it's a fun experiment! The instructions below are aspirational, rather than describing current functionality.

## Getting started

First install the `stage` CLI:

```
npm i -g stage
```

You can then create your first app:

```
stage create my-app
```

After creating the app, you can `cd` into the new directory and run it locally:

```
cd my-app
stage
```

## Deploying to production

Make sure you have your AWS credentials set up locally. These will be used to deploy your project.

Simply run:

```
stage deploy
```

The first deploy will take around 2 minutes, with any following deploys usually taking under 15 seconds!
